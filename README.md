# FeedFilter

A proxy for RSS/Atom feeds that removes entries the user would prefer not to see.

This can help remove advertisements, posts that link to podcasts, posts from uninteresting categories, posts by specific authors.

## Deployment

This application is built in .NET, and it requires a PostgreSQL database. The easiest way to deploy it is by using Docker Compose.

This repository includes a Docker Compose file. It configures FeedFilter and a PostgreSQL database. The Docker Compose file is configured to expose HTTP on port 3333 on localhost (it wonâ€™t be accessible from other machines); a reverse proxy (e.g. `nginx`) should be put in front to make it securely accessible to the feed reader.

The Docker image is hosted on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/K-Wojciechowski/FeedFilter/pkgs/container/feedfilter), with the latest release available as `docker pull ghcr.io/k-wojciechowski/feedfilter:latest`.

## Configuration

Feeds and their filtering rules must be configured. There are two ways to configure the feeds: by using the API or the UI.

The configuration API and UI must be enabled in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Admin": {
    "Token": "the-secret-token",
    "ApiEnabled": true,
    "UiEnabled": true
  }
}
```

### Configuration UI

The configuration UI can be accessed in a Web browser by going to the `/_admin` endpoint of the FeedFilter server. The UI is easy to use and allows configuring everything the API allows.

### Configuration API

All requests to the configuration API must have the token specified using an `Authorization: Bearer the-secret-token` header.

Each field must have a unique ID, which becomes the URL under which the feed can be retrieved.

<span id="feed-object"></span>

To configure a feed, make a POST request to `/api/feeds/{feedId}` with a **Feed object**:

```typescript
{
  "description": "feed description",
  "url": "feed URL",
  "defaultDecision": "accept" | "reject" | "promote" | "demote",
  "rules": [
    {
      "index": 0, // unique within a feed, determines rule sort order, first rule to match wins
      "field": "title" | "author" | "link" | "category" | "content" | "custom",
      "customXPath": "string" | null, // if field == "custom", the XPath of the element to test
      "testedAttributeName": "string" | null, // if null, will test the field contents
      "testType": 0,
      "testExpression": "exact" | "contains" | "startsWith" | "endsWith" | "regex", // regex is case-insensitive, remaining types are case-sensitive
      "decision": "accept" | "reject" | "promote" | "demote",
      "comment": "string" | null
    }
  ]
}
```

If the feed is saved successfully, the filtered feed will be available at `/{feedId}`. It is also possible to POST to `/api/feeds/{feedId}/test` to see which rule was applied to which entry.

The decisions are interpreted as follows:

* `accept` keeps the post in the feed and makes no changes
* `reject` removes the post from the feed
* `promote` prepends a star emoji to the post title
* `demote` prepends a trash can emoji to the post title

Before using XPath, make sure to read the [XML Hell](#xml-hell) section.

#### Example feed configuration call

```json
{
  "description": "Example",
  "url": "https://example.com/feed/",
  "defaultDecision": "accept",
  "rules": [
    {
      "index": 10,
      "field": "title",
      "testType": "contains",
      "testExpression": "[Sponsor]",
      "decision": "reject",
      "comment": "Remove ads"
    },
    {
      "index": 20,
      "field": "author",
      "testType": "exact",
      "testExpression": "John Doe",
      "decision": "demote",
      "comment": "Warn about John Doe's terrible writing"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### All endpoints

* `GET /api/feeds` and `GET /api/feeds/{feedId}` to see what is configured

* `POST /api/feeds/{feedId}` to create/update a feed

   Request body: a single [Feed object](#feed-object)
* `POST /api/feeds/{feedId}/test` to test a feed (perform filtering and show information about rules applied to entries)
* `DELETE /api/feeds/{feedId}` to delete a feed
* `POST /api/feeds` to create/update many feeds

   Request body: an array of [Feed object](#feed-object), with an additional `feedId` parameter in each object
* `POST /api/test` to test a feed without configuring it

   Request body: a single [Feed object](#feed-object)
* `GET /_healthcheck` to ensure the service is healthy

   Status code: 204 if healthy, 404 if no valid feeds are found in the database (possibly due to a misconfiguration), 500 if unhealthy.

*Hint:* The responses from GET endpoints can be passed into POST endpoints as-is. This can also be useful for importing and exporting the full configuration.

For more details, run the server in development mode and open `/swagger/`.

## XML hell

RSS and Atom feeds are XML. The "X" in "XML" stands for "Extensible", and one of the ways in which this extensibility is used are XML namespaces.

While RSS and Atom are separate formats, many RSS feeds found in the wild will include `xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"` and have some Atom tags in them (`atom:link` seems to be most common). Similarly, WordPress likes to define the post author using `dc:creator` (from `xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"`) and the post content in `content:encoded` (from `xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"`).

All the built-in rule field types have several XPath expressions associated with them, based on some feeds found in the wild. However, some feeds may have other ways to express some content.

The .NET `System.Xml.Linq` library requires namespaces to be included in XPath expressions. Moreover, namespaces must be registered before they are used. The `atom`, `dc`, and `content` namespaces explained above are registered. Alternatively, `*[local-name()='example']` can be used in XPath expressions to get `<[anything]:example>`.

## Roadmap

The filtering appears to be working on a handful of feeds I care about, produced by various generators (including, but not limited to, WordPress). There are still some more things to work on before this becomes usable. See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/K-Wojciechowski/FeedFilter/issues) for more details.
